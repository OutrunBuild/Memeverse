# ðŸ¤© Memeverse

Memeverse is a OmniChain memecoin launchpad built on the concept of FFLaunch, featuring memecoin staking and memecoin DAO governance. Compared to FFLaunch, Memeverse has no entry barriers. It has removed the customizable token generator interface and instead uses a universal token template to create memecoins. Users can deploy across all chains with just a few clicks via the website UI, without needing any programming knowledge.

For each memecoin, a corresponding Memecoin Yield Vault and Memecoin DAO Treasury are deployed on its governance chain. Users can stake memecoins into the yield vault to earn rewards, which come from the memecoin portion of the market-making profits of the locked genesis liquidity and other potential revenues. The UPT portion of the market-making profits from the locked genesis liquidity goes to the Memecoin DAO Treasury to support the decentralized operations of the memecoin community. Community members participate in governance by staking memecoins to control the use of treasury revenues.
