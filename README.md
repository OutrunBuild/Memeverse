# ðŸ¤© Memeverse

Memeverse is an omnichain Memecoin launchpad and Memecoin Staking protocol built based on the concept of FFLaunch. Compared with FFLaunch, Memeverse has no entry barriers at all. Memeverse has removed the customizable token generator interface and uses a universal token template to create Memecoins. Users don't need any programming knowledge and can complete all the omnichain deployments with just one click using our website UI. Creators of Memecoins can obtain the UPT portion of the continuous transaction fee income to support the operation of the Memecoin community and the development of practical functions. And each Memecoin has an ERC4626 Memeverse vault, which allows Memecoins to be staked into the vault to obtain staking rewards. The rewards come from the Memecoin portion of the transaction fee income as well as other potential revenues.
